## Mobile Flashcards

Mobile Flashcards is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.  

Features:
* Allows users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
* Allows users to add a card to a specific deck.
* Users can flip a card to see the answer.
* Users are able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
* Users receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.
* Data is stored locally on the device.
