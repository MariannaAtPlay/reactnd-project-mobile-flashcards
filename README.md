## Mobile Flashcards

Mobile Flashcards is a mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.  

Features:
* Allows users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
* Allows users to add a card to a specific deck.
* Users can flip a card to see the answer.
* Users are able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
* Users receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.
* Data is stored locally on the device.

### Try it out

* fork and clone to get the source code on your local computer
* to install the dependencies, use `npm install` or `yarn install`
* to start the app, use `npm start` or `yarn start`
* use an iPhone [simulator](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) OR Android emulator to run this in the browser or Expo mobile app to run this on your phone - [this one](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) is for iOS, but there is an equivalent for Android.

### Platform

This code should work on both iOS and Android, but has been tested on iOS only.

This project was bootstrapped using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
